# Reanimate: Microvascular Fluid & Mass Transport Solver

Reanimate is a C++ library to simulate fluid and mass transport in microvascular networks. 
The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and flexible framework to simulate blood flow, interstitial flow, and tracer or drug delivery in large microvascular networks. 
These networks are imported as weighted, undirected graphs which represent a network(s) of blood vessels generated either synthetically or by segmenting and skeletonising biomedical images. 

Reanimate implements some of the most popular models in microvascular modelling, including:
